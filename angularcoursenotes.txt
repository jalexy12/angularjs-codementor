Class Notes: 

Clear communication of online tools before we start

Technical issues are a pain in the ass 

Very slow pacing at first(half hour)  due to technical difficulties and laggers

Many concepts were introduced via questions

zoom.us for video chat

slack for communication

koding.com for an online IDE

Often times going through a concept relatively quickly, and then going back and doing a complete overview

follow along with him > discuss

Stopping very frequently after introducing something to ask questions

Clearly stating what we should have gotten out of the lesson of the day afterwards, and opened it up to questions afterwards

Recorded version of the lesson available the day after the course
 


My Notes:

Expression: {{ }} used to tell angular we want to display something

Controllers: Handdle the business logic of our angular application

Directive: ng-whatever, tells angular we have something here
